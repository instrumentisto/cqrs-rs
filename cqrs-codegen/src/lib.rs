/// # Enums
///
/// When deriving [`cqrs::Event`] for enum, the enum is treated as a sum-type
/// representing a set of possible events.

/// In practice this means, that [`cqrs::Event`] can only be derived for an enum
/// when all variants of such enum have exactly one field (variant can be either
/// a tuple-variant or a struct-variant) and the field have to implement
/// [`cqrs::Event`] itself.

/// Generated implementation of [`cqrs::Event::event_type`] would match on all
/// variants and proxy calls to each variant's field.

/// # Examples
/// ```
